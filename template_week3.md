# Instructions for Assignment 2 submission 

- Please copy the contents of this markdown as the starting template of your assingment. 
- The resulting file from this programming assingment must be submitted to the private repo you submitted for my review during assignment one. 
- The name of the file has to follow  naming convention:  *lastname*_week3.ipynb
- There are four sections of this assignments required to receive full credit. 
- Please see that the expected file is a Jupyter notebook which contains Python code and markdown, just like shown in class and in my recap video from week 2. 


# Section 1) Fetch of MNIST dataset (10%)

(This section shows the commands used to fetch the dataset successfuly with no errors.)

# Section 2) Display and examination of the MNIST dataset (15%)

(This section shows commands you did to examine the dataset, at minimum two commands and outputs with some examplanation is required for full credit. Use Python comments or markdown to comment your work.)

# Section 3) Train a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) binary classifier (45%)

(This section requires you to train your SGD binary classifier with the MNIST dataset to identify the number of interest to you. For full credit indicate the number you are aiming to classify and show all of the commands that show the model training. Use Python comments or markdown to comment your work.)

# Section 4) Determine the precision of your SGD classifier using a Confusion matrix (30%)

(This section requires you to show the commands that evaluate the precision of your classifier using a confusion matrix. For full credit you must clearly show all of the commands and results. Use Python comments or markdown to comment your work.)
